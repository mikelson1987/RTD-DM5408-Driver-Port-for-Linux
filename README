RTD DM5408 Driver Port for Linux


Home:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/dm5408/


Description:

A Linux driver for RTD DM5408 / DM408 ISA acquisition card. A DKMS module and 
a dynamic library written from scratch but trying to keep same functions 
structure of its official Windows 98 driver.


Note:

This is my first real project using C. I just want to learn writing Linux 
drivers for simple electronic hardwares. I use Ubuntu 10.04 for development.

Well, I have tested both digital ports for input, :) Cool it works.
